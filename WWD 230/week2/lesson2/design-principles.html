    <h2>Visual Heiarchy</h2>
    <p>Example found from <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/">Disney World .com </a></p>
    </a>
    <p>Mobile View Screenshot: <img src="Visual Heiarchy.JPG" alt="Mobile view of Visual Heiarchy"></p>
    <p>This page shows Visual Heiarchy because the most important parts are at the top of the page, and as you go
        down you less-important details, or details that won't immediately draw you to Disney.

        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <p>Example found from <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/">Just Watch - the Streaming Guide</a></p>
        <p>Mobile View Screenshot: <img src="three-rule.JPG" alt="Mobile view of View of Thirds"></p>
        <p>This page shows the Rule of Thirds because in the mobile view, if you were to lay a 3 by 3 grid on the screen,
            the main attraction (all the movies) are placed where the grid intersect.

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <p>Example found from <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a></p>
        
        <p>Mobile View Screenshot: <img src="WhiteSpace.JPG" alt="Mobile view of White Space and Clean Designn"></p>
        <p>This page shows White Space and Clean Design because inbetween each different link or picture there is 
            a space that helps show the difference. There's also padding within the search bar, and text on the screen has a good
            amount of space before the next line.
